# MultipleFPT are generated for articles with a quantity of more than one.
# It will start with a quantity_available of the same amount as the
# article's quantity. When a MFPT is processed, it will create a new FPT
# with a certain quantity_bought and reduce it's own quantity_available by
# that amount. When quantity_available is zero, it will transition to a
# "sold" state.
